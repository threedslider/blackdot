- *** Oh well, I am come back to my base in C++, ok I am working on parallel this and I make my project more simple to complex in step by step ***- 
- *** Hope that will work as well because my blackdot fork from Blender are messy ***
- *** So I keep two project as well and see which it is better ***


Blackdot
-------------

Blackdot is the free and open source 3D creation suite and it greatly is inspired from Softimage XSI.
It works as wip the entirety of coming to later :  the 3D pipeline-modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing,
motion tracking and video editing.

-------------

- [] UI from Softimage XSI
- [] Tools in 3D modeling (based on Softimage XSI)
- [] OOM (Oriented Object Modeling)
- [] Metamesh modeling
- [] ICE system (based inspiration from geomety nodes)
	- [] Particles
	- [] Deform
	- [] Kinematic
	- [] CrowdFX
- [] Hair system
- [] Advanced 3D painting
- [] New NPR shading
- [] 3D Rendending
	- [] Fujiyama
	- [] Povray

I am inspired by two peoples and hope I will bright to you for your enjoy with this Blackdot too in 3D.

- Thanks to Ton Roosendaal for the awesome Blender and help me to understand from codes.
